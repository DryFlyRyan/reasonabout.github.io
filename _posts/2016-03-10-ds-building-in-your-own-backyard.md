## Building in your own backyard
How to set up a simple JavaScript development environment on your on computer

## Welcome newcomers!
Have you been playing around with JavaScript and not know how to get started making things on your own computer? Would you like to be able to build applications outside of a sandbox you found online?

This repo will walk you through the steps to get started as simply as possible.
In this repo we will cover the following:
  * Text Editor
  * Homebrew
  * Git
  * Node
  * http-server
  * Basic app architecture

Attention: This Repo assumes OS X. Users of other platforms please refer to [this link](http://bfy.tw/4h2W)

## Step one: Downloading required software

Notice: ** This tutorial requires the use of the command line **

If the command line is something that instils fear I have some resources to get familiar with it. The terminal however will be mandatory for some of this tutorial and will be require to make use of your development environment. I highly encourage you to get familiar with your command line. Here is some useful links that helped me get familiar with it:
  [The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
  [The Command Line Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet/wiki/Terminal-Cheatsheet-for-Mac-(-basics-)
  [The Command Line Help](http://www.explainshell.com/)
  [The Command Line Mystery Game](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery/)

#### Text Editor
You will want to have a text editor to work and write your code in. There is much debate about what editor is best and I believe it is purely preferential. With that said, here are the two most commonly used for development and their respective download links:
  * [Atom](https://www.atom.io) - a hackable text editor
for the 21st Century
  * [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com) - a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.

#### Homebrew

Next we need to install [Homebrew](http://www.brew.sh) - The missing package manager for OS X.

Homebrew allows us to easily install software from the command line.

Enter this command into your terminal to download brew:
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```


#### Node.js
Node is a is a JavaScript runtime built on top of V8, Google Chrome's JavaScript engine.

To download it, open a new terminal window and enter the following command to install node:
```
$ brew install node
```
If you are not using brew, [you can download node here ](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### http-server
Now we will download http-server which is a [npm ](https://npmjs.com) package that very simply allows static applications to be served locally.

To do this, in your terminal window, run this command:
```
$ npm install http-server -g
```

## Step two: Building our application

#### Basic App Architecture
I will introduce a very basic architecture. You can put all of your CSS styling and JavaScript scripts inside of your HTML file but this is considered bad practice. The modularity and organization of code is important in modern day development and can be extremely complicated architectures. It is best that you begin practicing these techniques now as it will become beneficial in the future.

A common and basic application architecture consists of three files in one parent "application" folder, a HTML file `file_name.html`, a CSS file `file_name.css` and a JavaScript file `file_name.js`. For our example app we will call these three files:
* [index.html](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet/wiki/Terminal-Cheatsheet-for-Mac-(-basics-)
* [style.css](http://www.explainshell.com/)
* [app.js](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery/)

If you don't already have one, make a folder where you will put all of your development files and move into that folder. For myself I call mine "dev" but you are welcome to name it whatever fits for you.
```
$ mkdir dev
$ cd dev
```
Next make another folder to contain your application.
```
$ mkdir whatever_app_name_you_want_here
$ cd whatever_app_name_you_want_here
```
From this folder we will now add our three files.
```
$ touch index.html style.css app.js
```
Now open every file in your current working directory (folder you are in). If you chose atom as your text editor you can do this from the terminal with the following command:
```
$ atom .
```
Otherwise, you can open the files directly through your text editor.


#### Adding code
First go into your `index.html` file and copy/paste this code in:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Practice App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Hellow World!</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <input id="name_input" type="text" placeholder="Enter your name here">
      <button id="submit_name" type="button">Submit</button>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```
Next in your `style.css` file, copy/paste this code:
```css
body {
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100vw;
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: #272822;
  color: #F5F5F5;
}

main {
   display: flex;
  flex-flow: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

p {
  font-size: 20px;
}

input {
  width: 400px;
  height: 30px;
}

button {
  width: 100px;
  height: 30px;
}
```
Lastly in your `app.js` file, copy/paste this code:
```javascript
// tell the browser to wait to run this code until everything is loaded/ready
$(document).ready(function() {
  // tell the browser to run this function when the button with the id of submit_name is clicked
  $( "#submit_name" ).click(function() {
    // set the value of the input box to a variable
    var name = $( "#name_input" ).val();
    // clear all html from anything inside of the main tag
    $( "main" ).html("");
    // insert html into main, string concatination allows us to insert variables like name
    $( "main" ).append( "<p>My name is " + name + "</p>" );
    // add a button that users can click to run the app again
    $( "main" ).append( "<button id='refresh'>Go again</button>" );
    // when the button with the id of refresh is clicked, run this function
    $( "#refresh" ).click(function() {
      // refresh the page which restarts the application
      location.reload();
    })
  })
});
```
## Step three: Running the server

#### So simple...
While inside the application folder, run this command in the terminal:
```
$ http-server
```
That's it! It really is that simple! Now head to you browser and type in this url:
```
localhost:8080
```
and your application should be running at that url.

Now feel free to play with the JavaScript/CSS/HTML and have fun!
