    <p>I started my first job as a web developer recently, and I feel compelled to share
the lessons I’ve learned throughout my glorious week-long career.</p>

<h1 id="impostor-syndrome">Impostor Syndrome</h1>

<p>I finally made it. I’m seated at the big kid’s table. I’m one of them. I worked hard and it paid off. Now for the hard part: trick everyone into believing that I actually belong there.</p>

<h2 id="beginners-mind">Beginner’s Mind</h2>

<p>Let’s face it. I don’t know anything. I shouldn’t feel bad, but I do. I could go on and on about all the things I don’t know, but instead I’ll provide you with this handy reference for things I’ve learned that I should and shouldn’t pretend to know when starting a brand new career in web development.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Don’t pretend you like a language that you don’t.</li>
  <li>Pretend to understand how <em>git</em> works. (Everyone else does)</li>
  <li>Don’t pretend you know how to use <em>vim</em>.</li>
  <li>Pretend you believe that the person sitting next to you knows how to use <em>vim</em>.</li>
  <li>Don’t pretend you’d be capable of <strong>Anything</strong> without <em>stackoverflow</em>.</li>
  <li>Pretend you know how to turn on the light in the bathroom.</li>
  <li>Pretend you don’t know who people heard crying in the bathroom earlier.</li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Don’t pretend you know the guy that wrote _</td>
          <td>name of obscure framework goes here</td>
          <td>_.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>Pretend that FP is better than OOP.</li>
  <li>Pretend that OOP is better than FP.</li>
  <li>Don’t pretend you’ll survive without your mechanical keyboard.</li>
  <li>Pretend there was never a time you forgot to wear pants.</li>
  <li>Don’t pretend the terrible code you wrote isn’t terrible.</li>
  <li>Don’t pretend the terrible test you wrote effectively tests the terrible code you wrote.</li>
  <li>Pretend your code will start working if you just close your eyes and wish really hard. (I mean - really, <em>really</em> hard)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="overcoming-impostor-syndrome">Overcoming Impostor Syndrome</h2>

<p>Go luck with that.</p>

<h2 id="learning-to-live-with-impostor-syndrome">Learning to Live with Impostor Syndrome</h2>

<p>There may never be a time in the rest of my career that I will stop feeling like an impostor. With that in mind, I have prepared a few things I like to keep in mind as I continue to fail upwards.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I’m the only impostor at my office. Everyone knows it. For some reason people don’t seem to mind.</li>
  <li>I can’t speak intelligently about any subject, but my co-workers pretend to value my input.</li>
  <li>I exclusively write terrible code, but my co-workers seem more interested in building on top of it rather than blaming me for breaking things.</li>
  <li>I can’t stop my co-workers from pretending that there could be anything I have more experience in than they do.</li>
  <li>I can’t stop my boss from feeling like I’ll be useful one day.</li>
  <li>I can’t stop myself from feeling like an impostor.</li>
</ol>
